\problemname{Hissing Microphone}

A known problem with some microphones is the ``hissing s''. That is, sometimes
the sound of the letter s is particularly pronounced; it stands out from
the rest of the word in an unpleasant way.

Of particular annoyance are words that contain the letter s twice in a row.
Words like \texttt{amiss}, \texttt{kiss}, \texttt{mississippi} and even \texttt{hiss}
itself.

\section*{Input}

The input contains a single string on a single line. This string
consists of only lowercase letters (no spaces) and has between $1$ and $30$
characters.

\section*{Output}

Output a single line. If the input string contains two consecutive occurrences
of the letter \texttt{s}, then output \texttt{hiss}. Otherwise, output
\texttt{no hiss}.
