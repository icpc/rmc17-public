\problemname{Palindromic Password}

The IT department at your school decided to change their password policy. Each 
password will have to consist of $N$ $6$-digit numbers separated by dashes, 
where $N$ will be determined by the phase of the moon and the weather 
forecast for the day after it will be generated.

You realized that, if all of the numbers were palindromes (same numbers as 
the original ones if read backwards), you would have to remember a bunch 
of $3$-digit numbers, which did not sound that bad (at the time).

In order to generate your password of $N$ numbers, you get a list of $N$ 
randomly generated $6$-digit numbers and find the palindromic number closest 
to them.

Of course, you would like to automate this process...

\section*{Input} 
The first line of the input contains a single positive 
integer $N \leq 1000$ indicating the number of six-digit numbers in the 
input. Each of the next $N$ lines contains a six-digit number without 
leading zeroes.

\section*{Output}

For each six-digit number in the input, output another six-digit number 
that is closest to it and is also a palindrome. ``Closest'' in this 
context means ``a number having the smallest absolute difference with the 
original number''. If there are two different numbers satisfying the above 
condition, output the smaller one of the two. Remember, no leading zeroes.
