\problemname{Multiplication Game}

Alice and Bob are in their class doing drills on multiplication and division.
They quickly get bored and instead decide to play a game they invented.

The game starts with a target integer $N \geq 2$, and an integer $M =
1$.  Alice and Bob take alternate turns.  At each turn, the player
chooses a prime divisor $p$ of $N$, and multiply $M$ by $p$.  
If the player's move makes the value of $M$ equal to the target $N$, 
the player wins.  If $M > N$, the game is a tie.

Assuming that both players play optimally, who (if any) is going to
win?
\section*{Input}

The first line of input contains $T$ ($1 \leq T \leq 10\,000$), the
number of cases to follow.  Each of the next $T$ lines describe a
case.  Each case is specified by $N$ ($2 \leq N \leq 2^{31}-1$)
followed by the name of the player making the first turn.  The name is
either \texttt{Alice} or \texttt{Bob}.

\section*{Output}

For each case, print the name of the winner (\texttt{Alice} or
\texttt{Bob}) assuming optimal play, or \texttt{tie} if there is no
winner.
